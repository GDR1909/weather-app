        <h2>Information on your right to object pursuant to Art. 21 GDPR</h2>
        <h3>Right to object on a case-by-case basis</h3>
        <p>You have the right to object, on grounds relating to your particular situation, at any time to processing of personal data concerning you which is based on Art. 6 para. 1 lit. f GDPR (data processing on the basis of a balancing of interests); this also applies to profiling based on this provision within the meaning of Art. 4 no. 4 GDPR.</p>
        <p>If you object, we will no longer process your personal data unless we can demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds for the processing which override your interests, rights and freedoms, or the processing serves the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims.</p>
